    "#ans-in python you add comments to your code to provide explanation,clarify functionally or make notes for yourself or other developers\n",
    "#who may read the code .python supports two types of comments.single line comments and multiline comments\n",
    "#1.single line comment-to add a single line commment use the hash symbol followed by the comment text.anything after the hash symbol on\n",
    "#that line is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter for example\n",
    "#example-this is a single line comment.\n",
    "#2.multiline comments-python doesnt have a specific syntax for multiline like some other programming languages.however ypou can use triple\n",

    "#set(): Converts a value to a set data type.\n",
    "#dict(): Converts a value to a dictionary data type.\n",
    "#Type-Specific Conversion Functions: Some data types have their own specific conversion functions. For example, the list() function can convert a string or tuple to a list, or the str() function can convert a numeric value to a string.\n",
    "#String Conversion to Numeric Types: You can convert a string to numeric types like int or float using the respective type conversion functions. For example:\n",
